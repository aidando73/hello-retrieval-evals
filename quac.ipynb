      "Convinced by Jean Bennett and Tony Williams that \"Only You\" had potential, Ram had the Platters re-record the song during their first session for Mercury. Released in the summer of 1955, it became the group's first Top Ten hit on the pop charts and topped the R&B charts for seven weeks. The follow-up, \"The Great Pretender\", with lyrics written in the washroom of the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas by Buck Ram, exceeded the success of their debut and became the Platters' first national #1 hit. \"The Great Pretender\" was also the act's biggest R&B hit, with an 11-week run atop that chart. In 1956, the Platters appeared in the first major motion picture based around rock and roll, Rock Around the Clock, and performed both \"Only You\" and \"The Great Pretender\".  The Platters' unique vocal style had touched a nerve in the music-buying public, and a string of hit singles followed, including three more national #1 hits and more modest chart successes such as \"I'm Sorry\" (#11) and \"He's Mine\" (#23) in 1957, \"Enchanted\" (#12) in 1959, and \"(You've Got) The Magic Touch\" (#4) in 1956. The Platters soon hit upon the successful formula of updating older standards, such as \"My Prayer\", \"Twilight Time\", \"Harbor Lights\", \"To Each His Own\", \"If I Didn't Care\", and Jerome Kern's \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\". This latter release caused a small controversy after Kern's widow expressed concern that her late husband's composition would be turned into a \"rock and roll\" record. It topped both the American and British charts in a Platters-style arrangement.  The Platters also differed from most other groups of the era because Ram had the group incorporated in 1956. Each member of the group received a 20% share in the stock, full royalties, and their Social Security was paid. As group members left one by one, Ram and his business partner, Jean Bennett, bought their stock, which they claimed gave them ownership of the \"Platters\" name. A court later ruled, however, that \"FPI was a sham used by Mr. Ram to obtain ownership in the name 'Platters', and FPI's issuance of stock to the group members was 'illegal and void' because it violated California corporate securities law.\"  The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in its inaugural year of 1998. The Platters were the first rock and roll group to have a Top Ten album in America. They were also the only act to have three songs included on the American Graffiti soundtrack that fueled an oldies revival already underway in the early to mid-1970s: \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\", \"The Great Pretender\", and \"Only You (and You Alone)\".
