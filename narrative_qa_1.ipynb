Stained wagon-wheel coffee\\n     tables.\\n\\n     Domino notices the LA-Z-BOY in the corner of the room.

She moves further into the family\\n     room.\\n\\n     Edna may have shitty taste... but she isn\\'t poor. Domino\\n     notices the MITSUBISHI widescreen. Surround Sound. DVD\\n     Player. The Manchurian Candidate is playing.\\n\\n                          DOMINO\\n                The Manchurian Candidate, huh\\n                Edna?\\n\\n     In the KITCHEN... Edna leans over and grabs a BUDWEISER\\n     longneck from a STYRO-FOAM COOLER. With the shotgun still in\\n     her left hand, she cracks the bottle open with her right and\\n     takes a long swig.\\n\\n                          EDNA\\n                Is that you, Domino?\\n\\n                          DOMINO\\n                Nice to see you again, Edna.\\n\\n     Edna lets out a sly cackle... wiping the bitter tears from\\n     her face.

The RAGE returns.\\n\\n                          EDNA\\n                YOU DON\\'T HAVE SHIT!\\n\\n     Domino turns back to Choco. He has unwrapped a LARGE OBJECT\\n     from the backpack. It remains hidden in the shadows. Domino\\n     stares at it with trepidation. She\\'s in over her head.\\n\\n     Choco steps forward into the light and we see that the object\\n     is a SEVERED HUMAN ARM. The BLOODY STUMP ends at the UPPER\\n     BICEP.\\n\\n     Choco lobs the arm over the KITCHEN COUNTER and it lands on\\n     the linoleum floor next to Edna with a loud thump.\\n\\n                          ED\\n                Don\\'t fuck with us, Edna!

She COCKS the shotgun and aims it\\n     blindly over the counter into the FAMILY ROOM.\\n\\n                          EDNA\\n                AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!\\n\\n     SHE UNLOADS TWO ROUNDS. TWO SHOTGUN BLASTS RIP HOLES IN THE WALL\\n     BETWEEN ED AND CHOCO.
